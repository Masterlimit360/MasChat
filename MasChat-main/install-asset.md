# Install expo-asset Dependency

To complete the splash screen setup, you need to install the expo-asset package:

```bash
npm install expo-asset@~10.0.2
```

Or if you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn add expo-asset@~10.0.2
```

This package is required for proper asset loading in the splash screen.

After installation, restart your development server:

```bash
npm start
```
